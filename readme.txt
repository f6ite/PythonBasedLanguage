Welcome to Kai's Amazing And Awesome Programming Language (KAAAPL)

The language itself is built on Python following the tutorials produced by CodePulse.

It implements basic mathmatical capabilities by running the shell.py file in CMD/Python console, using mathmatical logic BIDMAS to perform mathmatical functions (example 2^5 = 32).

It also has basic error messaging, providing feedback to erroneous inputs.

On top of this it also allows for basic code to be created using the .myopl file extension and then being run from the KAAPL console.
